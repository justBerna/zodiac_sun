# Zodiac Sun

To demonstrate my ability to quickly pick up new tools/languages, I created a small program in the functional programming language Haskell after about a week of studying it.  

Small Program to find and display some information about a person's zodiac sign given a date as input 

> NOTE: Date must be in the form: `MMM #` where `MMM` is the first three letters of the month in all caps. (Ex. JAN 1)
