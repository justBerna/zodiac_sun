# Zodiac Sun
A personal week-long challenge to showcase my ability to pick up new tools/languages quickly.  

Find and display some data on a user's zodiac sun sign, given their date of birth as input. 

# To Run 
[Install Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#)  <br /> <br />
In the directory with the project : 
```
ghc zodiac_sun.hs 
./zodiac_sun 
```

> NOTE: Date must be in the form: `MMM #` where `MMM` is the first three letters of the month in all caps. (Ex. JAN 1)
